# Self-Taught Evaluator model release

**2024-09-26**

We release the Self-Taught Evaluator model via the Hugging-Face model repo: https://huggingface.co/facebook/Self-taught-evaluator-llama3.1-70B. This model was trained using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO).

First, the model was trained on data comprising responses and evaluation plans generated by the seed model (see Section 3 in the paper). Next, the selected SFT model was used to generate higher quality evaluation plans for the preference finetuning dataset (see [section below](./README.md#synthetic-preference-data)). Finally, the released model was trained on preference finetuning data using the combination of DPO and NLL losses. The checkpoint selection was done using the pairwise judge accuracy computed over the Helpsteer2 validation set.

## Inference and Evaluation

We provide example scripts to use the Self-Taught Evaluator as a judge to choose a better response from a pair. We provide a set of scripts to reproduce the RewardBench evaluation scores for this model. Please refer to [src/requirements.txt](./src/requirements.txt). Our experiments were run with `vllm` version 0.6.1.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This model was trained to judge a pair of responses using the specific prompt format from the RewardBench benchmark. Make sure to adopt the same prompt format when you run the model on your data.

#### Example: running the model with a given set of user inputs & pair of assistant outputs.

Note: download example eval data here: https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/self_taught_evaluator/example_inputs.jsonl

1. Prepare your inputs similar to the ones found in [example_inputs.jsonl](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/self_taught_evaluator/example_inputs.jsonl)

2. Run `bash run_inference_wvllm.sh`. The generated outputs and parsed judgements will be saved in `example_outputs.jsonl`.

### Reproducing rewardbench evaluation score

Note: download the evaluation data here: https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/self_taught_evaluator/rewardbench_inputs.jsonl

1. Run `bash src/run_rewardbench.sh`.

2. Expected output:

```text
Chat            Chat Hard       Safety          Reasoning
0.969           0.851           0.896           0.884

Final score: 90.014
```

## Synthetic Preference Data

The pre-processed training data for preference fine-tuning can be downloaded here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/facebook/Self-taught-evaluator-DPO-data

Example script showing how to combine wildchat-1m prompts with DPO training data: [src/load_dpo_data_from_hf.py](./src/load_dpo_data_from_hf.py).

Below you can find instructions on how to replicate our data generation process.

### Generate worse response
1. Given pairs of (instruction, baseline response), prepare prompts using the template specified in `data/prompts/worse_response.prompt`.
2. Run generation on the prompts from step 1, to generate a "worse response" to the instruction.

### Generate judgement
1. Given tuples of (instruction, baseline response `0`, worse response `1`), we generate judgement using the prompt template specified in `data/prompts/eval_plan.prompt`. To avoid position bias, we generate evaluation plans for both orders of the responses positions. Specifically, for `0_1` order, we prepare the prompt using (instruction, baseline response, worse response), and for `1_0` order, we prepare the prompt using (instruction, worse response, baseline response).
2. Run generation on both `0_1` and `1_0` ordered prompts from step 1 to derive evaluation plans for pairwise preference.
3. Then we apply rejection sampling, where we collect multiple samples of evaluation plan, and only retain examples where the judgement prefers the baseline response to the worse response. To ensure label balance, we retain the same number of examples of `A is better` and `B is better`.

### Generation hyper-parameters

The experiments in the paper used vllm for generation, with temperature=0.7, and top_p=0.9, max_tokens=4096.

### Prepare training data

After generating samples of judgements (e.g. using vllm), run `python src/prepare_sft_data.py` and `python src/prepare_dpo_data.py` to prepare the training data.

## Model training details

Models were trained using the preference optimization recipe using the open-source [fairseq2 library](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq2). Training was executed on a SLURM-based cluster using multi-node A100 setup: 3 nodes training for first iteration SFT model and 8 nodes training for the second iteration DPO model that was released. Model selection is done via early stopping based on the pairwise judgement accuracy computed over the Helpsteer2 validation set.
