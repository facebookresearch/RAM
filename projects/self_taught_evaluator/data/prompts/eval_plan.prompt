Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the responses provided by two AI assistants to the user question displayed below. You should choose the assistant that follows the user's instructions and answers the user's question better. Begin your evaluation by first verifying whether each response contains any obvious or subtle errors. Then propose an appropriate evaluaiton rubric, e.g. 1-5 criteria that are important for evaluating responses to this specific user question. Continue your evaluation by checking each response carefully along those criteria. Based on the analysis in previous steps, choose which response is better overall. Avoid any position biases and ensure that the order in which the responses were presented does not influence your decision. Do not allow the length of the responses to influence your evaluation. Do not favor certain names of the assistants. Be as objective as possible. After providing your evaluation, output your final verdict by strictly following this format: \"[[A]]\" if assistant A is better, \"[[B]]\" if assistant B is better.
